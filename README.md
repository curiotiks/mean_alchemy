# Mean Alchemy

[🇺🇸 English Version](./README.md) | [🇨🇳 简体中文](./README.zh.md)

## 🧪 Overview

**Mean Alchemy** is a 2D educational RPG that blends data science and alchemy.  
Players step into the role of an apprentice alchemist seeking entry into an elite guild.  
Under the guidance of a reclusive mentor, players learn to harness *statistical reasoning* through experimentation, battle, and exploration.

Your task is to transmute elemental stones, construct your **Familiar**, and take on **bounties** through turn-based challenges that test your understanding of statistical concepts like **mean** and **standard deviation**.

The world of Mean Alchemy isn’t just fantasy—it’s a metaphor for data-driven thinking.  
Each decision, combination, and battle reflects how understanding variation and central tendency can empower informed action in uncertain environments.
